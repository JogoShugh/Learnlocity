  AgileDictionary.addWord('Distillation', 'A process of separating the components of a mixture to extract the essence in a form that makes it more valuable and useful.

It may use information that is accessible globally and may even change that global information but holds no private information that affects its behavior.');

  AgileDictionary.addWord('Supple Design', 'A design that puts the power inherent in a deep model into the hands of a client developer to make clear, flexible expressions that give expected results robustly. Equally important, it leverages that same deep model to make the design itself easy for the implementer to mold and reshape to accommodate new insight.');
