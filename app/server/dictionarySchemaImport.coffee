This means that the activities are designed and resourced to complete every role of the value stream in 30 minutes.

addWord 'Workspace', 'The area where stakeholder value is created. The workspace is an important concept in Lean process improvement because it is the location where customer value is created.'
addWord 'Work time', 'The wall clock time necessary to apply assets to create value added work if there are no blockages or interruptions. For example, the total work time to perform data entry for an order may only be a half hour; although the total wall clock time from when the order arrived on the desk of the data entry person until the time it left (service time) might be 4 hours.'
